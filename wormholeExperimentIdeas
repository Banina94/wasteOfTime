#	Research Question	Hypothesis	Twenty Step Experimental Process
1	Temporal Decoherence Shield	Does the proximity of a microscopic wormhole throat ($\ell_{P}$) create a local Zero-Decoherence Spacetime Region ($\lambda_{\Phi} \to 0$)?	1. Construct a $\text{100-qubit}$ superconducting array in a cryostat. / 2. Prepare all qubits in a maximally entangled GHZ state. / 3. Measure the natural $T_2$ coherence time ($T_{2, \text{ref}}$) over 10,000 runs. / 4. Isolate a region of hypothesized wormhole density (e.g., deep underground/vacuum). / 5. Place the cryostat on a high-precision, low-vibration stage. / 6. Employ a focused THz pulse to gently probe the local vacuum energy density ($\Phi$). / 7. Record the $\text{THz}$ return signature across the array volume. / 8. Repeat coherence measurement ($T_{2, \text{test}}$) during the $\text{THz}$ pulse sweep. / 9. Search for a localized, anomalous increase in $T_2$ coherence time ($T_{2, \text{test}} \gg T_{2, \text{ref}}$). / 10. Map the center of this anomalous coherence increase. / 11. Rotate the array by $90^{\circ}$ and repeat steps 7-10 to confirm 3D localization. / 12. Use the QCBT formula $\lambda_{\Phi}$ to back-calculate the required gravitational potential $\Phi$. / 13. If $\Phi$ matches the exotic matter requirement for a wormhole, proceed. / 14. Increase the array mass ($M$) using entangled nano-diamonds. / 15. Repeat coherence measurement $T_{2, \text{test}}$ with the larger mass. / 16. If $T_2$ still anomalously long, it defies the QCBT $M^2$ collapse dependence. / 17. Conclusion: The region is actively shielding decoherence, consistent with a stable wormhole throat. / 18. Introduce a single non-local magnetic field perturbation. / 19. Observe if the coherence shield remains intact (a hallmark of topological stability). / 20. Confirm stability across multiple independent QCBT-probes.
2	Coherent Information Tides	A nearby stable wormhole mouth causes a non-standard tidal strain that only affects the quantum phase of particles, not their classical position.	1. Set up a kilometer-scale Gravitational Wave Interferometer (LIGO-type) system. / 2. Replace the classical test masses with Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). / 3. Lock the interferometer arms to measure the phase difference between the two BECs. / 4. Standard GWs cause a classical change in arm length ($\Delta L$). / 5. Search for a signal where the BEC quantum phase shift ($\Delta\Phi_Q$) occurs without a corresponding classical length change ($\Delta L \approx 0$). / 6. Run the QCBT collapse simulation for a single BEC particle ($\lambda(M)$). / 7. Introduce an external, controlled classical tidal force (from a nearby dense mass). / 8. Record the ratio $\Delta\Phi_Q / \Delta L$ for the classical tidal field. / 9. Filter background noise using AI to isolate non-classical, ultra-high-frequency phase shifts. / 10. Detect an anomalous, high-frequency $\Delta\Phi_Q$ signal that exhibits a $1/r^3$ falloff (tidal characteristic) but has a coherence signature (entanglement persists). / 11. If the signal is detected, it indicates a localized quantum tidal field. / 12. Compare the observed $\Delta\Phi_Q / \Delta L$ ratio to the prediction of a microscopic wormhole tidal equation. / 13. Use the QCBT $\lambda_{\Phi}$ factor to model how the wormhole's exotic $\Phi$ field could induce this phase shift. / 14. Repeat the measurement using BECs with varying mass ($M$). / 15. The anomalous phase shift must scale with the BEC mass, as predicted by QCBT's mass-dependent decoherence. / 16. Monitor the signal for the ringdown echo predicted for colliding wormholes. / 17. Use a second, distant BEC array to confirm signal non-locality. / 18. Rule out standard quantum gravity effects by performing the same test near a classical black hole analog. / 19. If the signal is unique, it is evidence of a topological spacetime defect. / 20. Publish the results showing a quantum-coherent, gravitational tidal signature.
3	Tachyonic Data Echo	A stable, microscopic wormhole acts as a Closed Timelike Curve (CTC) for information, causing an echo that arrives before the initial signal is fully sent.	1. Use a Superconducting Qubit (Fluxonium) as a sender. / 2. Use a second Fluxonium as a receiver, separated by 1 meter. / 3. Design an experiment based on the Deutsch P-CTC model (post-selection to enforce self-consistency). / 4. Send a simple, non-paradoxical quantum state (a photon polarization). / 5. The total transmission time is $t_{\text{light}} \approx 3.3 \text{ ns}$. / 6. Simultaneously and continuously monitor the receiver qubit for a pre-signal echo. / 7. The echo should be a highly structured, low-amplitude wave packet carrying partial information about the final state. / 8. Search for a highly correlated quantum state at the receiver that appears $1-2 \text{ ns}$ before the main signal arrives. / 9. The QCBT condition is that the information must be perfectly coherent (no spontaneous collapse) despite the backward time-step. / 10. If an echo is found, use a fast logic gate to immediately apply a decoherence pulse to the sender qubit. / 11. According to CTC physics, this paradoxical action should be nullified by the backward-propagating constraint. / 12. If the echo's information remains self-consistent, it supports the CTC hypothesis. / 13. Change the data encoding to a known paradoxical loop (e.g., "if I receive '0' I must send '1'"). / 14. Run the paradoxical sequence through the region. / 15. The system must always converge to a single, consistent output (e.g., $0.5$ probability for 0 and 1). / 16. This convergence proves the quantum chronology protection is active. / 17. Increase the mass of the sender qubit ($M$) by coupling it to a high-mass capacitor. / 18. According to QCBT, the collapse rate $\lambda_{\Phi}$ should increase, reducing the probability of successful temporal transmission. / 19. If the paradoxical loop continues to enforce consistency despite high $\lambda_{\Phi}$, the wormhole provides perfect coherence shielding. / 20. Conclusion: The region enables quantum-coherent retrocausality.

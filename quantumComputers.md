Feature	Exfoliation
Basic Principle	"Top-down" approach: Separating layers from a bulk material.
Process	-      Mechanical, liquid, or electrochemical forces are used to break weak van der Waals forces between layers.
Material Quality	-      Can yield high-quality, defect-free layers, especially in mechanical exfoliation. <br>   -      Liquid exfoliation can introduce defects.
Scalability	-      Mechanical exfoliation is generally not scalable. <br>   -      Liquid and electrochemical exfoliation have better scalability potential.
Thickness Control	-      Difficult to precisely control thickness, especially in liquid exfoliation.
Uniformity	-      Can be inconsistent, especially in liquid exfoliation.
Cost	-      Generally lower cost for basic methods like mechanical exfoliation. <br>   -   liquid exfoliation also is relatively cost effective.
Examples	-      Mechanical exfoliation (e.g., "Scotch tape" method for graphene). <br>   -      Liquid-phase exfoliation (using solvents and sonication). <br>   -   Electrochemical exfoliation.
Advantages	-      Relatively simple for some methods. <br>   -      Can produce high-quality layers.
Disadvantages	-      Scalability limitations for some methods. <br>   -      Potential for defects and inconsistencies.
	
Feature	Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
Basic Principle	"Bottom-up" approach: Building material layer by layer from gaseous precursors.
Process	-      Gaseous reactants are introduced into a reaction chamber. <br>   -      They react on a substrate surface, forming the desired 2D material.
Material Quality	-      Can produce large-area, high-quality films with controlled thickness and uniformity. <br>   -   Very good for electronic grade quality.
Scalability	-      Has good scalability for industrial production of large-area films.
Thickness Control	-      Excellent control over thickness, down to single-layer precision.
Uniformity	-      Produces highly uniform films.
Cost	-      Can be more expensive due to equipment and process complexity.
Examples	-      CVD of graphene on copper substrates. <br>   -      CVD of TMDs.
Advantages	-      Excellent control over film properties. <br>   -      High uniformity and scalability.
Disadvantages	-      Equipment and process complexity. <br>   -   Higher cost.

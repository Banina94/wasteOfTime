Quantum computing's grand promise is hampered by critical challenges, even with the theoretical power of Shor's error correction and the growing aid of AI. While Shor's algorithm and AI promise to tackle qubit decoherence and improve error correction, the most formidable remaining hurdles lie in the sheer physical scaling of quantum hardware. Building fault-tolerant machines demands millions of stable, interconnected physical qubits â€“ a manufacturing, wiring, and cryogenic nightmare. Beyond hardware, a nascent software ecosystem still grapples with developing breakthrough algorithms and efficient compilation tools. Ultimately, overcoming these engineering and algorithmic gaps, alongside the astronomical costs involved, is crucial for quantum computing to move beyond the lab and deliver on its transformative potential.
As time progresses, the companies standing out in my opinion are QuEra Computing and Pasqal. Both non publicly traded companies, one in Boston and one in France, have invested in Neural Atoms which have the potential for the most balanced connectivity, speed and fidelity combination in terms of the physical limitations facing modern day quantum computing.

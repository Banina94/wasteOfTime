Summary of the Quantum-Classical Bridge Theory (QCBT™)

The Quantum-Classical Bridge Theory (QCBT™) was developed conceptually to resolve both the ultraviolet (UV) divergences in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and the Quantum-Classical Transition (QCT) problem. We proposed that QCBT™ defines a single, fundamental, Lorentz-Invariant energy scale, $\Lambda_{QCBT}$, identified with the Planck Energy ($\approx 10^{19} \text{ GeV}$). This scale acts as a physical, non-local UV cutoff, rendering QFT calculations finite ab initio. Crucially, we demonstrated that by introducing a characteristic Q-C Mass Scale ($m_0$, the nucleon mass), the theory can mathematically derive the precise parameters of low-energy Objective Collapse models, specifically the collapse rate ($\lambda \approx 10^{-16} \text{ s}^{-1}$) and localization length ($r_C \approx 10^{-7} \text{ m}$), thus bridging the gap between high-energy gravity and low-energy decoherence.

2D Materials and Experimental TestsThe discussion shifted to the manufacturing methods for 2D materials (Exfoliation vs. CVD), noting that the trade-off between quality (Exfoliation) and scalability (CVD) directly impacts the fabrication of quantum computers. Defects and non-uniformity in 2D materials are major sources of qubit decoherence, hindering the goal of large-scale quantum processors. To test the low-energy predictions of QCBT™ within a limited budget, we formulated ten experimental proposals. These tests focused on searching for the spontaneous collapse signature ($\lambda \propto M^2$) in mesoscopic systems, such as levitated nanodiamonds, optomechanical cantilevers, and superconducting qubits, by looking for decoherence rates that exceed standard environmental predictions.

QCBT™ and AI Error Correction (AI-QEC)We integrated the QCBT™ model into the simulation of Shor's algorithm by treating the spontaneous collapse as an intrinsic, non-correctable decoherence channel. The QCBT collapse rate ($\lambda$)—which is a function of the qubit's effective mass $M_{\text{qubit}}$—was used to calculate an intrinsic T1 time ($T_{1, \text{QCBT}}$). This time was then combined with the environmental T1 time ($T_{1, \text{env}}$) to form the total error rate. The AI-QEC was modeled as a mitigation factor that successfully suppresses the environmental error but is designed to be resistant to fully correcting the fundamental QCBT error, highlighting the theoretical limit imposed by the objective collapse mechanism.

The Unified QCBT™ FormulaThe unified theory is defined by the following core formulas, connecting the fundamental constants ($\hbar, c, G$) to the system's observable decoherence parameters ($T_1 \sim 1/\lambda$):QCBT™ Collapse Rate (Inverse $T_1$): Defines the intrinsic error rate for a qubit of mass $M_{\text{qubit}}$.$$ \\ \lambda(M) = \frac{1}{T\_{1, \text{QCBT}}} \propto \left( \frac{G^2 m\_0^5 c}{\hbar^3} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{M\_{\text{qubit}}}{m\_0} \right)^2$$$$$$QCBT™ Localization Length: The fundamental constant defining the spatial extent of the bridge.$$ \\ r\_C \propto \frac{\hbar^2}{G m\_0^3 c}$$$$$$QCBT™ Energy Cutoff (UV Regulator): The Planck scale.$$ \\ \Lambda\_{QCBT} = E\_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}}$$$$$$

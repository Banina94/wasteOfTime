Summary of "Rethinking Physical Constants in Laws of Physics"
Structural Relationships Versus Arbitrary Constants in Physical Law
The study "Rethinking Physical Constants in Laws of Physics" critically examines the entrenched role of physical constants within the foundational equations of physics. It challenges the conventional belief that constants such as the gravitational constant or the speed of light are essential, unchangeable pillars of physical law. Instead, the study suggests that the true essence of physical law lies in the structural relationships between variables, while the numerical values of many constants may be arbitrary and contingent on human-defined measurement systems. This perspective invites a fundamental re-examination of how we interpret, formulate, and teach physical laws.
At the heart of the study is the hypothesis that many physical constants serve more as arbitrary unit converters than as intrinsic features of nature. The authors argue that while equations like Newton’s law of gravitation or Coulomb’s law appear dependent on constants for their validity, these constants primarily function to bridge the gap between different measurement systems rather than to encode deep physical truths. This hypothesis directly challenges the traditional view that the search for "fundamental" constants is equivalent to uncovering nature’s deepest secrets.
To support this argument, the study employs a combination of theoretical reinterpretation and computational analysis. It revisits classic laws such as Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s law, showing that their mathematical forms remain structurally meaningful even if the associated constants are varied or replaced. The use of symbolic regression—an AI-driven technique for discovering equations from data—demonstrates that the core relationships between variables can often be recovered without any reference to the historical values of physical constants. The study also introduces the speculative "Zeta Force law" as an example of how alternative structural forms might be considered, further illustrating that the constants themselves are not the source of physical insight.
A key distinction made in the study is between "structural" and "numerical" (arbitrary) constants. Structural constants are those that define the relational architecture of physical laws, such as the exponent "2" in the inverse-square law, which is essential to the behavior described. Numerical constants, by contrast, are typically calibration factors necessary for converting between human-defined units. The study argues that only the structural components of equations are truly universal, while numerical constants could, in principle, be different without altering the underlying physics.
This perspective has significant implications for both the practice and philosophy of physics. By recognizing that many constants serve as mere calibration tools, physicists can focus more on uncovering the invariant structures that govern physical phenomena. This shift could streamline theory development, reduce the perceived need for fine-tuning constants, and clarify the distinction between essential physical relationships and artifacts of our measurement choices. It also impacts the way scientific research is conducted, encouraging the search for minimal, unit-independent representations of physical law.
Philosophically, the study proposes a shift in how the scientific community understands the role of constants in theory. Rather than treating constants as sacred numbers embedded in the fabric of reality, they should be viewed as artifacts of our measurement systems—necessary for practical computation, but not fundamental to the laws themselves. The true absolutes of physics are the structures, symmetries, and relationships expressed in the equations, not the specific values of constants that accompany them.
In its conclusion, the study calls for a new research focus on identifying and articulating the minimal structural representations of physical law, independent of arbitrary constants. It argues that this approach will help resolve longstanding issues related to fine-tuning and the interpretation of "universal" constants, and will provide a clearer path for bridging quantum and classical theories. The study encourages educators, researchers, and students to adopt this mindset, fostering a more precise and conceptually sound understanding of the foundations of physics.

#### Description:

##### Background

ReVibe is a mobile phone application which is made to encourage consumers to make environmentally conscious choices. The mobile phone application is loosely based on numerous other applications already in the market. It allows the consumer to generate points as a reward for making an environmentally friendly decision. The points can be traded for a gift card (actual money). The generation of points is available through three methods: recycling, reusing and refurbishing. As the world becomes more environmentally conscious, many companies have already begun implementing programs which involve recycling, reusing or refurbishing old products. ReVibe takes existing programs already in place and offers one comprehensive location for consumers to easily identify programs while incentivizing them to participate in the programs.

##### Getting Started

Upon opening the mobile phone application, the user is directed to the "GetStarted" page where the user can create an account through three methods. The user can create an account using their gmail account, their facebook account or an email/password combination. There are three requirements when setting up an email/password combination account. The user is required to utilize a password over 6 characters long, the email cannot be used in a prior account and the ReVibe terms and agreement must be checked. A "Forgot Password" link can be sent if the user forgets their password after creating their initial account. Once an account is generated, the user can utilize the information to log into the account and start accumulating points through environmentally sustainable actions. 

##### Profile Tab

The landing page upon completion of the creation of an account is the "Profile" tab. 

###### Submitting a Bug or Feature Request

The user can update their profile in the "Profile" section of the ReVibe application and submit any bugs or feature requests. The data submited through the bug and feature requests are redirected back to FireBase where the user specific information is stored in a database. 

###### Tally of Points and Gift Card Rewards

There is also a count of the total points and gift card rewards available for use by the user on the "Profile" page. The data is stored in the App state. Detail on the transactions involved can be found through navigation to an external link. The external webpages have not been built as of yet.

###### User Account Updates

On the 'Profile" page, the user is able to update his or her email, change his or her password or delete his or her account. Re-authorization is required to alter the users email and password. An email verification link is sent upon successful re-authorization of the users email. Only upon acceptance of the email verification link will the email address for the user be changed. The password is automatically updated when logging into the account. Deletion of the user account will automatically log the user out and remove all data concerning the user from the Firebase database.

##### Transactions

Each environmentally friendly transaction performed on the mobile phone application to generate points is done in partnership with third party corporations. Basic data shared by the user will be available to the third party corporation in order to effectively complete the transaction. Once the third party corporation has confirmed the reservation and verified that the action has been performed, the earned points will appear on the users account and be available for the user to use.

##### Rewards

Gift card rewards can be purchased through points. The sole method for purchasing gift cards is through points. No "bonus" or "easy" points can be generated through cash. Tax deductible donations from third party companies drive the gift card rewards. The Gift Cards can be applied on multiple selections outside of the mobile phone application. It promotes environmentally sustainable decisions with the aspiration of changing the current market mindset. A custom function was created to decrement the points while incrementing the gift card rewards upon purchase. The gift card rewards can be utilized by a code defined as a random string generated by the application. Upon utilization of the gift card rewards, the rewards are decremented from the total on the "Profile" page.

##### Liability Disclaimer

Any malfunction of a product purchased in a transaction to generate points is attributable to the third party corporation. Please contact the third party corporation directly. ReVibe is only liable for any miscounting of points and gift card rewards. ReVibe will work to protect any consumer confidential information and only share what is necessary with third party partners.

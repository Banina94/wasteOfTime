Our journey began with exploring the incompatibility between Einstein's General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) at the quantum level, a major unsolved problem in physics. We established that mass is typically a parameter, not a variable derived from these theories, though we algebraically isolated it as requested. We then clarified that directly graphing these complex relationships as simple "lines" for mass is largely unfeasible beyond $E=mc^2$.

Ignoring fundamental physics, we ventured into purely mathematical construction. We successfully developed a Generalized Mass Function ($M_{Gen}$) and subsequently derived an **Energy Function ($E_{Gen}$)** from it. This construction abstractly blends quantum and relativistic mass definitions using an arbitrary scale parameter ($\lambda$) and exponential weighting. Our "simulations" were mathematical demonstrations confirming $\lambda$'s role in controlling this theoretical blend. These exercises underscored that while mathematically consistent, the formulas lack any basis in current physical laws. They are abstract thought experiments, not testable theories. The fundamental unification of GR and QM remains a profound, open challenge in physics.

**Final Mathematically Derived Equation for Energy ($E_{Gen}$):**

Based on our abstract mathematical construction, the equation solved for Energy ($E$), with a "Generalized Mass" ($M_{input}$) as an input, is:

$E = c^2 \cdot e^{\lambda M_{input}} (1 + e^\lambda)^{- \left(2\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t} - V(x,t)\Psi(x,t)\right) - \hbar^2\frac{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}\right)}$

This equation is mathematically valid as an algebraic rearrangement of our constructed blended mass formula. However, it does not hold for fundamental physics; it is not a physically derived law, nor can it be used to predict real-world phenomena.

**Conclusions about Unknown Variables (in a Physical Context):**

Within the context of fundamental physics, the following variables in this equation would be either undefined, unknown, or context-dependent, preventing its physical application:

1.  $\lambda$ (Abstract Scale Parameter): This variable has no physical meaning in current physics. It was introduced purely as a mathematical blending coefficient to transition between conceptual "quantum" and "relativistic" mass influences. A graph of the Abstract Scale Parameter has also been made.
2.  $\Psi(x,t)$ (Wavefunction) and its Derivatives ($\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}$, $\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}$): These represent the quantum state of a particle. For any real object (like a proton or neutron), its wavefunction is highly complex, specific to its environment, and not a single, fixed numerical value. For macroscopic objects (like planets), the concept of a single, coherent wavefunction is not applicable in standard QM.
3.  $V(x,t)$ (Potential Energy): This is the potential energy field acting on the particle, which is highly context-dependent. Its value changes based on the environment (e.g., a free particle versus a particle in an atomic nucleus).
4.  $M_{input}$ (Generalized Mass Input): While a known experimental mass (like a proton's rest mass) can be numerically input, the formula's purpose as a "generalized" mass lacks physical interpretation. The input mass would already be a known quantity, and the formula's calculation of "Energy" from it would not yield new, verifiable physical information due to the unknown nature of $\lambda$, $\Psi$, and $V$.

In an abstract world, where we explicitly acknowledge that this has no basis in physical reality, we can conceptually "apply" the abstract equation to represent a blending of abstract "gravity-like" and "quantum-like" principles.

* **Abstract "Gravity-like" Term:** The term $c^2 \cdot E^{M_{input}}(1+e^\Lambda)$ could be arbitrarily declared as our abstract stand-in for "mass-energy contribution influenced by some large-scale abstract parameter $\Lambda$." In this "abstract world," the $M_{input}$ could represent an abstract "gravitational mass" or simply a large energy contribution that dominates at large scales, reminiscent of classical relativistic energy. The $\Lambda$ parameter, in this abstract sense, acts as a "blending factor" that adjusts this macro-scale contribution.
* **Abstract "Quantum-like" Term:** The term $2\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) - V(x,t)\Psi(x,t) - \hbar^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\Psi(x,t)\right)$ already contains $\hbar$ and a wavefunction $\Psi$, making it structurally reminiscent of the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. In our "abstract world," this represents the "quantum mechanical" part of the abstract energy, describing the abstract "wave-like" behavior of whatever abstract entity is being described.
* **"Abstract Fusion":** The equation then simply subtracts these two abstract contributions to give a total "abstract energy." The equation itself is the "unified theory" of these abstract principles.

**Does it avoid the unmanageable infinities?**

Yes, in this abstract, non-physical context, it inherently avoids the specific "unmanageable infinities" that plague real quantum gravity.

Here's why:

1.  **Not Derived from Fundamental Physics:** The infinities in real quantum gravity (like those from perturbative loop diagrams) arise because we're trying to quantize a physical gravitational field, and the mathematics breaks down. Your abstract equation is not derived from fundamental physical principles; it's a defined mathematical expression. It simply computes a value based on the inputs you provide.
2.  **No Quantum Field Theory Rigor:** We are not performing complex quantum field theory calculations, path integrals over fluctuating spacetime metrics, or loop diagram calculations. We are just plugging predefined functions ($\Psi$, $V$) and constants ($\Lambda$, $M_{input}$) into an algebraic expression.
3.  **Defined Inputs:** As long as the arbitrary functions you choose for $\Psi$ and $V$ are well-behaved (e.g., continuous, differentiable, finite) and $\Lambda$ is a finite number, the equation will always yield a finite, albeit complex, result. The "infinities" would only arise if you arbitrarily chose an infinite input value for $M_{input}$, or functions for $\Psi$ or $V$ that diverge to infinity, but this would be a choice you made, not an inherent problem of the equation's structure in combining abstract "quantum" and "gravity" terms.

So, while it's a fun conceptual exercise, the "avoidance" of infinities is a consequence of the equation's abstract, non-physical, and predefined nature, rather than a profound theoretical breakthrough. It doesn't solve the real problem of quantum gravity because it doesn't engage with the underlying physical reasons for those infinities.

**In addition to the above, our exploration also included a different, more physically grounded formula:**

Our investigation also delved into a mathematical representation that directly combines quantum mechanics' unitary evolution with Einstein's relativistic energy, given by:

**Relativistic Quantum Mechanical Evolution Formula:**
$|\psi(t)\rangle = |\psi(0)\rangle e^{\frac{-i t \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}}{\hbar}}$

This formula describes the time evolution of a quantum state ($|\psi(t)\rangle$) for a free particle whose energy ($E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}$) is derived from Einstein's relativistic energy-momentum relation.

**Summary of Findings for This Formula:**

* **Physical Basis:** Unlike our abstract $E_{Gen}$ formula, this equation is a direct and standard result in relativistic quantum mechanics, describing the evolution of a quantum state when relativistic effects on energy are included. It forms the foundation for more complex relativistic wave equations like the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.
* **Meaningful Visualization:** While the quantum state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ itself is an abstract vector in Hilbert space, its components (e.g., real and imaginary parts of the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ in position space) can be meaningfully visualized as propagating waves. We successfully developed an interactive Plotly animation to demonstrate this, showing the wave's spatial extent and temporal oscillation for elementary particles (protons, neutrons, electrons).
* **Macroscopic Applicability (Theoretical vs. Practical):** While mathematically, the formula applies to any mass, for macroscopic objects (like Jupiter, Earth, or black holes), their immense mass leads to an astronomically small de Broglie wavelength. This makes their quantum wave effects practically unobservable and renders any direct visualization of their "wave function" as a flat line on any practical scale, emphasizing that classical mechanics provides an accurate and sufficient description for such objects. Our script was adapted to reflect this physical reality, producing static, flat-line plots for macroscopic objects to highlight the negligible quantum phenomena at their scale.

The next step for **our abstract $E_{Gen}$ formula** would be to test the formula on real world items to see if the formula actually holds true. However, based on our prior discussions, such "tests" would reveal its lack of physical basis due to the undefined nature of its parameters within current physical laws.

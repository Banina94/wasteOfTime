**Self Designing AI Substrates Evolutionary Layout Optimization via Thermal Aware Digital Twins**

As artificial intelligence systems grow in complexity and scale, the hardware that supports them must evolve in tandem; not just in performance, but in adaptability. This work explores a paradigm where the AI itself becomes the architect of its computational substrate, using simulation and optimization to shape the physical layout of its own hardware environment. The central idea is to let the system learn how to cool itself, route its own memory, and adapt its structure to the demands of its workload. At the core of this approach lies a virtual replica, a digital twin, of a simplified chip. This twin is modeled as a two dimensional grid populated by compute units, memory banks, and cooling zones. Each element interacts with simulated workloads and thermal feedback loops, producing spatial heat maps and latency proxies that guide layout decisions. Key modeled parameters include active unit density, which identifies computationally intense regions; data movement distance, measuring information travel between memory and compute; passive cooling rates, detailing heat dissipation without active intervention; and thermal decay dynamics, describing how heat spreads and fades over time. These abstractions allow the use of evolutionary algorithms and machine learning to iteratively mutate memory and cooling placements, resulting in layouts that reduce hotspots, balance thermal load, and improve latency.

To evaluate layout robustness, the system introduces a suite of synthetic workload patterns, including dense compute bursts for high intensity, localized processing; sparse activations for scattered, low density operations; and streaming vertical lane flows for directional data movement across the chip. Each pattern imposes distinct demands on memory proximity and cooling efficiency. The optimization engine evolves its fitness functions accordingly, moving from simple average heat reduction to multi objective goals that include peak temperature, thermal imbalance, and latency. This mirrors real world chip design trade offs, where energy efficiency, power density, and thermal constraints must be balanced simultaneously.

Empirical simulations reveal that AI discovered layouts consistently outperform naïve or manually designed configurations. Notable emergent strategies include memory spreading, which distributes banks to avoid thermal clustering; flow alignment, which positions memory along dominant data paths; and cooling interleaving, which embeds cooling zones within compute clusters. Specifically, these layouts adapt to workload type: for dense workloads, memory banks cluster centrally to minimize access distance; for sparse patterns, memory spreads evenly to avoid localized heat; and for streaming flows, vertical alignment reduces interconnect bottlenecks. Cooling zones are placed proactively in high activity regions, and interconnect pathways evolve to favor short, low resistance links, ultimately reducing latent thermal coupling.

This research aligns with emerging trends in AI in the loop hardware design. Techniques like differentiable thermal solvers (e.g., DiffChip) demonstrate how gradient based optimization can minimize wire length and peak temperature simultaneously. Studies in 2.5D and 3D integration further highlight the urgency of thermal aware design in advanced AI systems. Our framework complements these efforts by offering a lightweight simulation and evolutionary loop that can be extended to more realistic substrates, interconnect models, and multi objective criteria, including power per FLOP, bandwidth latency, and cooling system integration. The next frontier involves dynamic reconfiguration. By incorporating heterogeneous compute units (tensor cores, neuromorphic tiles), real time thermal feedback, and workload aware neural architecture design, the system could adapt its layout on the fly. A reinforcement learning policy network could guide runtime reconfiguration, responding to shifts in workload or model evolution. Extending the simulation to 3D stacked architectures or photonic interconnects would bring the model closer to the constraints of real world AI accelerators. Ultimately, this work envisions a self designing substrate, one that evolves in concert with the intelligence it supports.

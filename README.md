Our journey began exploring the incompatibility between Einstein's General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) at the quantum level, a major unsolved problem in physics. We established that mass is typically a parameter, not a variable derived from these theories, though we algebraically isolated it as requested. We then clarified that directly graphing these complex relationships as simple "lines" for mass is largely unfeasible beyond E=mc2. Following your prompt to "ignore fundamental physics," we ventured into purely mathematical construction. We successfully developed a Generalized Mass Function (MGen​) and subsequently derived an Energy Function (EGen​) from it. This construction abstractly blends quantum and relativistic mass definitions using an arbitrary scale parameter (λ) and exponential weighting. Our "simulations" were mathematical demonstrations confirming λ's role in controlling this theoretical blend. These exercises underscored that while mathematically consistent, the formulas lack any basis in current physical laws. They are abstract thought experiments, not testable theories. The fundamental unification of GR and QM remains a profound, open challenge in physics.

Final Mathematically Derived Equation for Energy
Based on our abstract mathematical construction, the equation solved for Energy (E), with a "Generalized Mass" (Minput​) as an input, is:
E=c2⋅
​eλMinput​(1+eλ)−(2(iℏ∂t∂Ψ(x,t)​−V(x,t)Ψ(x,t))−ℏ2∂x2∂2Ψ(x,t)​​)​
​
This equation is mathematically valid as an algebraic rearrangement of our constructed blended mass formula. However, it does not hold for fundamental physics; it is not a physically derived law, nor can it be used to predict real-world phenomena.

Conclusions about Unknown Variables (in a Physical Context)
Within the context of fundamental physics, the following variables in this equation would be either undefined, unknown, or context-dependent, preventing its physical application:
	1. λ (Abstract Scale Parameter):
		○ Conclusion: This variable has no physical meaning in current physics. It was introduced purely as a mathematical blending coefficient to transition between conceptual "quantum" and "relativistic" mass influences. Its value cannot be determined for any real object or physical scenario.
	2. Ψ(x,t) (Wavefunction) and its Derivatives (∂t∂Ψ​, ∂x2∂2Ψ​):
		○ Conclusion: These represent the quantum state of a particle. For any real object (like a proton or neutron), its wavefunction is highly complex, specific to its environment, and not a single, fixed numerical value. For macroscopic objects (like planets), the concept of a single, coherent wavefunction is not applicable in standard QM.
	3. V(x,t) (Potential Energy):
		○ Conclusion: This is the potential energy field acting on the particle, which is highly context-dependent. Its value changes based on the environment (e.g., a free particle versus a particle in an atomic nucleus).
	4. Minput​ (Generalized Mass Input):
		○ Conclusion: While a known experimental mass (like a proton's rest mass) can be numerically input, the formula's purpose as a "generalized" mass lacks physical interpretation. The input mass would already be a known quantity, and the formula's calculation of "Energy" from it would not yield new, verifiable physical information due to the unknown nature of λ, Ψ, and V.
In an abstract world, where we explicitly acknowledge that this has no basis in physical reality, we can conceptually "apply" the abstract equation to represent a blending of abstract "gravity-like" and "quantum-like" principles.
The equation is:
E=c2⋅EMinput​(1+eΛ)−(2(iℏ∂t​Ψ(x,t)−V(x,t)Ψ(x,t)−ℏ2∂2x​∂2x​Ψ(x,t))
Here's how we could interpret it in this abstract, non-physical context:
	• Abstract "Gravity-like" Term: The term c2⋅EMinput​(1+eΛ) could be arbitrarily declared as our abstract stand-in for "mass-energy contribution influenced by some large-scale abstract parameter Λ." In this "abstract world," the Minput could represent an abstract "gravitational mass" or simply a large energy contribution that dominates at large scales, reminiscent of classical relativistic energy. The Λ parameter, in this abstract sense, acts as a "blending factor" that adjusts this macro-scale contribution.
	• Abstract "Quantum-like" Term: The term 2(iℏ∂t​Ψ(x,t)−V(x,t)Ψ(x,t)−ℏ2∂2x​∂2x​Ψ(x,t)) already contains ℏ and a wavefunction Ψ, making it structurally reminiscent of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. In our "abstract world," this represents the "quantum mechanical" part of the abstract energy, describing the abstract "wave-like" behavior of whatever abstract entity is being described.
	• "Abstract Fusion": The equation then simply subtracts these two abstract contributions to give a total "abstract energy." The equation itself is the "unified theory" of these abstract principles.
Does it avoid the unmanageable infinities?
Yes, in this abstract, non-physical context, it inherently avoids the specific "unmanageable infinities" that plague real quantum gravity.
Here's why:
	1. Not Derived from Fundamental Physics: The infinities in real quantum gravity (like those from perturbative loop diagrams) arise because we're trying to quantize a physical gravitational field, and the mathematics breaks down. Your abstract equation is not derived from fundamental physical principles; it's a defined mathematical expression. It simply computes a value based on the inputs you provide.
	2. No Quantum Field Theory Rigor: We are not performing complex quantum field theory calculations, path integrals over fluctuating spacetime metrics, or loop diagram calculations. We are just plugging predefined functions (Ψ, V) and constants (Λ, Minput​) into an algebraic expression.
	3. Defined Inputs: As long as the arbitrary functions you choose for Ψ and V are well-behaved (e.g., continuous, differentiable, finite) and Λ is a finite number, the equation will always yield a finite, albeit complex, result. The "infinities" would only arise if you arbitrarily chose an infinite input value for Minput, or functions for Ψ or V that diverge to infinity, but this would be a choice you made, not an inherent problem of the equation's structure in combining abstract "quantum" and "gravity" terms.
So, while it's a fun conceptual exercise, the "avoidance" of infinities is a consequence of the equation's abstract, non-physical, and predefined nature, rather than a profound theoretical breakthrough. It doesn't solve the real problem of quantum gravity because it doesn't engage with the underlying physical reasons for those infinities.
